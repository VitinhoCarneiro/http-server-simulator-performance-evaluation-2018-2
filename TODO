Things to do:

- Implement random variables
    - (DONE) Exponential


To simulate my server, I need:
- Queue to store incoming events
- Incoming event generator
    - I need to implement random variable distributions (exponential in this case)
- Server
    - The server picks one event from the start of the queue and processes it in an exponentially random amount of time.
    - The server just idles if the queue is empty
- I need to know:
    - The portion of time the server is idle
    - The distribution (mean and variance) of:
        - Rate of incoming requests (demand)
        - Rate of served requests (throughput)
        - Rate of dropped requests (dropout)
        - Rate of requests rejected by timeout (timeout)
        - Server load (demand/throughput)
        - Queue length
        - Turnaround time
        - Service time
